    @@ cache status

        Prints the status of the local cache of archive indices.
        (On/off, where indices are stored)

    @@ cache on ?dir?

        Activates the local caching of archive indices using DIR as
        the location where the indices are stored. If DIR is not
        specified the hardwired standard location is used, regardless
	of anything stored in the configuration already.

        All future queries will use the locally cached indices to
        perform searches.

    @@ cache off

        Deactivates the local caching of archive indices. All future
        queries will go over the network to the archives to perform
        searches. Note that the contents of an existing cache are
        NOT deleted, just not used. To delete use 'cache clear'.

    @@ cache clear

        Clears the local cache of archive indices. This forces a
        refetch of the indices the next time @@ is used. The command
        fails if caching is disabled at the time of its invokation, as
        it is then not known where to look for the indices.
