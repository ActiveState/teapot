        Prints the contents of the meta-data keyword "Description" for
        the NAMEd package as found in the configured set of
        archives. The output can be restricted to a specific VERSION
        or ARCHitecture of the package.

	If no architecture was specified the command will consider
	only instances for the current architecture.

	Using the string 'ALL' as architecture will cause description
	of all instances regardless of architecture.

        If the option --all is specified then all meta data known for
        the package is printed, instead of just the description.

        All other options are standard options, explanations can be
