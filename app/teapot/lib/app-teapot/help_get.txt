        Retrieve the package files for all instances of the NAMEd
        package found in the configured set of archives. The retrieval
        can be restricted to a specific VERSION of the package, and
        even a specific ARCHitecture of that. It can also be forced to
        retrieve all packages (by specifying neither NAME nor VERSION
        nor ARCHitecture).

        The retrieved files are placed into the directory specified
        via option --output], with file names constructed from the
        package name, version, architecture, and type of archive.

        If the option --output is not present the @@ will default to
        the current directory.

        The other options are standard options, explanations can be
