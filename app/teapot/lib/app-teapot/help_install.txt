        Installs the entity contained in the FILE or URL without
        searching through and retrieving it from the configured set of
        archives. However dependencies of the package are still
        searched in and retrieved from the archives.

        Installs the NAMEd entity, either the highest version, or at
        least VERSION, or the exact version, and all its dependencies
        (recursive). The destination is the chosen installation.

    Options:

    --force

        Usage ensures the installation of the package even if the
        declared dependencies could not be met, i.e. if one or more
        required packages are not found in the set of configured
        archives.

    --with-recommends

        Makes recommended packages required dependencies.

    --arch ARCH

        Explicitly specifies the architecture of the host
        we are on. If not specified the default architecture
        of the installation is used. Has to be an architecture
        accepted by the chosen installation.
