    @@ link make PATH SHELL

        Create a connection between the installation repository at
        PATH and the tcl shell SHELL. From then on the SHELL will
        search the repository when a package is required, and the
        repository knows that SHELL is one its users. The latter means
        that @@ will check the shell when attempting to install a
        package.

    @@ link cut (PATH|SHELL) (PATH|SHELL) ...

        Removes the connection between the installation repository at
        PATH and the tcl shell SHELL. From then on the SHELL will
        _not_ search the repository when a package is required, and @@
        will not check the shell anymore when installing a package.

        Note that it is allowed to specify an arbitrary number of
        SHELLs and repository PATHs, in arbitrary order. The command
        will disconnect all possible pairs.

    @@ link info PATH|SHELL

        Prints either the list of shells the repository at PATH is
        connected to, or the list of repositories the SHELL is using.
