        Lists all instances of the NAMEd package found in the
        configured set of archives. The output can be restricted to a
        specific VERSION of the package, or forced to contain all
        packages (by specifying neither NAME nor VERSION).

        If a NAME was specified, but nothing was found the command
        does a case-insensitive substring search for candidate names
        and then re-does the operation for all found candidates. This
        fixes typos like 'bwidget' instead of 'BWidget', but also
        means that 'zlib' will find 'zlibtcl', etc.

	--all-platforms

	    By default the output is limited to packages which can be
	    installed on the local platform, as defined by the shells
	    the installation repository is linked to.

	    By specifying this option all packages in the archives are
	    shown, even for platforms which are not relevant here.

        --only uninstalled|newer|unknown|update

            Limiter option for output.

            update, newer

                Of the installable entities known to the registered
                archives, show only those which are installed in the
                installation repository and have a newer version in
                archives
