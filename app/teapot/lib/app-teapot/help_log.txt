    log -- Manage the log of installed/removed packages

    @@ log show ?-l|--last N? ?-s|--since TIMESTAMP? ?--at DIR?

        Show the log of installed/removed packages of either the
        default installation repository, or the repository pointed to
        by --at.

        Normally the whole log is shown, but this can be restricted to
        either the last n entries, or the entries made after a given
        date and time. The restrictions cannot be combined. When
        specifying more than one the last one will be used.

        The log will be printed to the standard output in a simple
        tabular format, with the oldest entries coming last. I.e. the
        newest entries can be found at the top of the log.

    @@ log purge ?--keep-last N? ?--keep-since TIMESTAMP? ?--at DIR?

        Purges the log of installed/removed packages of either the
        default installation repository, or the repository pointed to
        by --at.

        Normally the whole log is purged, but this can be restricted
        to all but the last n entries, or all but the entries made
        after a given date and time. I.e. either the last n entries
        are kept in the log, or the entries made after the given date
        and time are kept in the log. The restrictions cannot be
        combined. When specifying more than one the last one will be
        used.

    The argument N has to be an integer number greater than zero.

    The argument TIMESTAMP may have one of the following forms:

    *   INTEGER              Unix epoch value.
    *   YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS  ISO DATE+TIME
    *   YYYY-MM-DD           ISO DATE only, the time defaults to midnight.
    *   HH:MM:SS             ISO TIME only, the date defaults to today.

    An example of the output format is

	2007-03-02 14:16:12 1 remove  package udp      1.0.8 linux-glibc2.2-ix86
	2007-03-02 14:10:04 1 install package udp      1.0.8 linux-glibc2.2-ix86
	2007-03-02 14:09:50 1 install package Diagrams 0.2   tcl

    The columns are DATE, TIME, SERIAL, ACTION, ENTITY, NAME, VERSION,
    ARCH; in this order.

        DATE, TIME are the date & time when the log entry was made.

	SERIAL is a serial number which distinguishes entries should
	they happen to be made in the same second. It is counted from
	1 up per invocation of @@.

	ACTION is either 'install', or 'remove'.

	ENTITY is the type of the entity installed/removed, currently
	either 'package' or 'application'.

	NAME, VERSION, and ARCH identify the entity more, by name,
	version and architecture, also known as platform.

    The lengths and positions of the columns SERIAL, ENTITY, NAME,
    VERSION, and ARCH are dynamically determined from the entries
    printed. The other columns all have fixed lengths, but may change
    position.

        DATE  10 chars.
	TIME   8 chars.
	ACTION 7 chars.
