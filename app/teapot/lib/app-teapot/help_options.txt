    options -- The standard options for many commands


    --dry-run

	This option is like "make -n". It causes the application to
	simulate the requested actions, but to not change any state.

    --at-default

	This option causes the application to use the local default
	installation instead of the configured set of archives.

    --at DIR

	This option causes the application to use the local
	installation at DIR instead of the default installation.
	I.e. it can be used instead of --at-default.

    --is ENTITY

        This option causes the application to restrict itself to
	entities of the specified type. If this option is not
	specified actions influence all entities matching the name,
	version, etc., independent of their type.

    --as profile|table|csv

	This option determines the format of the output for list and
	search commands. By default a human readable table it can be
	switched to be either a .tm profile package listing all found
	instances as its dependencies, or a table of comma-separated
	values.

    --http-proxy HOST:PORT

        This option overrides all proxy settings from environment,
        teacup configuration, etc. with a setting just for the current
        command.

    -v

        This option activates additional output providing more
        information about @@ activities, like the decision-making
        process about the usage of locally cached indices.

    --timeout SECONDS

        This option forces the use of a specific timeout when
        retrieving information from a remote repository. It overrides
        the settings from the configuration, and the hardwired
        defaults. A value <= 0 disables timeouts, allowing for
        infinite waiting.
