    queries -- Describe the syntax of complex queries.

    The basic query operators are

        -is    ENTITY           is a particular entity
        -has   KEY              has the key in the meta data
        -eq    KEY VAL          value for KEY is equal to VAL
        -lt    KEY VAL          value for KEY is less than VAL
        -gt    KEY VAL          value for KEY is greater than VAL
        -re    KEY REX          value for KEY matches the regexp REX
        -glob  KEY GLOB         value for KEY matches the glob pattern GLOB
        -in    KEY VAL          The list value for KEY contains VAL
                                as element

    and the negated forms

        -nis   ENTITY           is not a particular entity
        -nhas  KEY              has not the specifed key in the meta data
        -ne    KEY VAL          value for KEY is not equal to VAL
        -ge    KEY VAL          value for KEY is greater than or equal to VAL
        -le    KEY VAL          value for KEY is less than or equal to VAL
        -nre   KEY REX          value for KEY does not match the regexp REX
        -nglob KEY GLOB         value for KEY does not match the glob pattern GLOB
        -ni    KEY VAL          The list value for KEY does not contain VAL
                                as element

    All simple conditions imply that a matching instance also has the
    specified key in their meta data.

    The basic queries can be composed into more complex ones using the
    operators

        -a -and         x AND y
        -o -or          x OR y

    The AND operator binds tighter than OR, use parentheses,
    i.e. '(' and '), to group queries to break this.

    NOTE that parentheses are often special to the shell used to
    invoke @@, i.e. they may require quoting to be passed unchanged to
    @@.

    The braces '{' and '}' can be used in place of parentheses as well, these
    do not need quoting at shell-level.

    As example

        @@ search is profile and {     \
             eq platform tcl        or \
             eq platform win32-ix86    \
        }

    Or, using parentheses, and assuming a bourne shell

        @@ search is profile and \(    \
             eq platform tcl        or \
             eq platform win32-ix86    \
        \)


    All operators can be used with and without their dash ('-'). The only
    exceptions are the short combinators -a and -o.

    As example, the two following queries are equivalent:

        @@ search -in subject hashing
        @@ search in subject hashing
