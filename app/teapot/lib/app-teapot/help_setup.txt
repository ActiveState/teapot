    @@ setup SHELL

        While ActiveTcl's tcl shell comes already prepared with all
        the code necessary to be able to look for and use installation
        repositories most Tcl shells, especially self-built ones, do
        not.

        This command takes the path to a valid Tcl shell SHELL and
        then adds all this code, enabling the SHELL to look for and
        use installation repositories as well.
