Setting up and using TEAPOT repositories
========================================

I. Per Server Repository
------------------------

1.      Create a directory for the repository and set it up as a repository.
2.      Populate the repository with packages.
3.      Start the server using the populated repository.

Ad 1.   % teapot-admin create /path/to/repo/directory
Ad 2.   % teapot-admin add -v /path/to/repo/directory packagefile...
Ad 3.   % teapotd             /path/to/repo/directory port

II. Per User
------------

1.      Create a per-user local repository.
2.      Configure the TEAPOT client to use this as local repository.
3.      Configure the TEAPOT client for all server repositories you
        wish to use. See section I on how to set up a server
        repository.

Ad 1.   % teapot setup --shell /path/to/tclsh
or	% teapot setup --all

        Note! This does not cause the tclsh to automatically use the
        packages in the repository. See the section III on how to do
        that.

        The path of the repository is printed on stdout.

	The -all variant initializes the repository for tclsh*/wish*
	found in the PATH.

	If the repository is created (and not extended with new
	shells) it is also made the local repository. Step 2 can then
	be skipped.

Ad 2.   % teapot default /path/to/local/repository (from step 1).
Ad 3.   % teapot archive add URL

        The URL can be a path or of the form http://HOST:PORT/
        where
        * HOST :        Name of host running the teapot demon.
        * PORT :        Port given to the teapot demon when it was
                        invoked. See I.3.

III. Per Tcl installation
-------------------------

1.      Make the package "platform" available to the tclsh of the
        installation.

2.      Make the standard link code available to the tclsh of the
        installation.

Ad 1.   Copy the contents of <DISTRO>/lib/platform to a location
        where the tclsh in question will looks for packages.

Ad 2.   % teapot-admin linkcode > /path/to/a/file

	This retrieves the standard link code.

	This code has to be put into the file

		'[info library]/init.tcl'

	of the Tcl installation in question. This an administrator
	operation.

Behind the scenes (for II. and III.)
------------------------------------

*       "teapot setup" creates a local repository in the
        directory

                "$HOME/.teapot/repository",

        To make the packages in this repository available to a tclsh
        it (the shell) has to execute the 'link code'. This happens if
        this code is placed in the global file 'init.tcl' of that
        tclsh.

*       The link code mentioned above uses the package 'platform'
        to determine the architecture ARCH of the tclsh which is
        running, and then links the relevant subdirectories of

                "$HOME/.teapot/repository"

        of that repository to the "auto_path" of the shell, and to the
        search path for Tcl Modules (if possible), thus making the
        packages available.

        To see the code simply run

        % teapot-admin linkcode

        or read "bin/teapot_linkcode.tcl" in the distribution.
