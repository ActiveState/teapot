Package references
==================

A package is a list having the pname of the package as first element,
followed by zero or more option/value pairs detailing the reference.

Examples:
	{md5}
	{md5 -version 1.1}
	{struct::graph -version 1.2.1 -exact 1}

The following options are known and recognized by all repositories.

Option		Notes
------		-----
-version	Value is a version number.
------		-----
-exact		Value is boolean. If set the exact package version is
		requested. If not set, or missing higher version
		numbers within the major version are allowed.

		If -exact 1 is specified then -version has to be
		specified as well.
------		-----
-platform	Value is one of {win,unix,mac}.

		Declares that the reference is conditional and valid
		if and only if the client repository has this value
		for $tcl_platform(platform).
------		-----
-platformid	Value is a glob pattern

		Declares that the reference is conditional and valid
		if and only if the platform identifier of the client
		repository matches the pattern.
