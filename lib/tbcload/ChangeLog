	* configure.in: Bumped version to 1.6. Regenerated configure.
	* configure:

	* cmpInt.h:  Applied patch by Uwe Traum to handle the 8.5
	* cmpRead.c: specific JumpTableInfo (compiled 'switch'). Made
	  conditional on the version of Tcl the package is compiled
	  against.

2006-01-25  Andreas Kupries <andreask@activestate.com>

	* tclconfig/tcl.m4: Updated to TEA 3.5
	* configure.in:     Ditto.
	* configure:        Regenerated.

	* Makefile.in (AR): use @AR@
	* configure, tclconfig/tcl.m4: TEA 3.2 patch update

2005-03-17  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* configure, tclconfig/tcl.m4: Updated to TEA 3.2
	* Makefile.in, configure.in:
	* tclconfig/ChangeLog (removed):

2003-04-04  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* configure.in:
	* tclconfig/tcl.m4: Updated to newest tcl.m4, regenerated
	  configure's.

2002-12-02  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* cmpInt.h: Bugfix: Ensure the correct TCL_STORAGE_CLASS on
	  Windows for the functions exported by the package
	  'tclcompiler'. Unfortunately their declaration is here, in
	  'tbcload'. The header cmpInt.h is shared by both packages.

2002-11-28  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* cmpRead.c: Fixed small typos in comments.

2002-10-25  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* cmpRead.c (CreateSimpleObject): Removed unused variable 'savedChar'.
	  (TbcloadInit): Removed unused variables 'major', and 'minor'.

2002-10-15  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tclconfig/tcl.m4:
	* configure:
	* configure.in: move the CFLAGS definition into TEA_ENABLE_SHARED
	and make it pick up the env CFLAGS at configure time.

2002-10-15  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* configure.in: Changed to propagate an initial CFLAGS value to
	  the final definition. A TEA condition (SHARED_BUILD == 1)
	  squashed it, causing it the build system to loose the
	  +DAportable we specify for the AS PA-RISC2.2 build host. This is
	  a problem for _all_ TEA and TEA 2 based configure files.

2002-10-01  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* cmpRead.c (ExtractCompiledLocal): enhanced check for setting
	VAR_UNDEFINED to only do it for code compiled with < 8.4 and be
	loaded into >= 8.4.

2002-09-30  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* cmpInt.h:
	* cmpRead.c (ExtractSignature): reduced overly complex sig check.
	(TbcloadInit): make formatVersion change with interpreter.
	Remove dead code.

	* cmpInt.h: bump to version 1.4.0
	* configure.in:

	* cmpRead.c (ExtractCompiledLocal): add VAR_UNDEFINED to new
	locals to match the optimization which uses this in 8.4.  Harmless
	for pre-8.4 interps.

2002-09-30  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* Makefile.in: 
	* configure.in:
	* tclconfig:
	* aclocal.m4: Rewritten to conform to TEA 2.

2001-03-14  Karl Lehenbauer <karl@procplace.com>

	* mkIndex.tcl.in: Altered Nativepath proc to work correctly with 
	  new Cygwin drive specification syntax when running on Windows.

2000-07-25  Brent Welch  <welch@ajubasolutions.com>

	* mkIndex.tcl.in: Hacked this to set the execute bit on
	the HP-UX .sl file, which is neccessary before you can load it.

2000-03-29  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* cmpRead.c (CreateSimpleObject): removed savedChar trick and used
	direct byte count for NewStringObj
	(CleanupByteCode): added docs, noting that TclCleanupByteCode in
	tclCompile.c had to add code to account for precompiled ByteCodes,
	and clean up their literals

2000-03-29  Scott Redman  <redman@scriptics.com>

	* tests/tcl/procRedefNub.tcl:
	* tests/tcl/procRedef.tcl:
	* tests/cmpRead.test: added tests for proc redefinition
