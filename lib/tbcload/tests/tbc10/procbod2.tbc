# procbod2.tcl --
#
#  Test file for compilation.
#  Contains two procs; the first is compiled, the second is not.
#  The body for the second is generated from a "info body" command on the
#  first; this is a construct that we don't support with the debugger, and
#  an error is generated when the second proc is executed.
#  Checks that the correct error is generated.
