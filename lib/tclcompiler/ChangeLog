	* cmpWrite.c: Handle TIP#336 addition of API to access
	interp->errorLine.

2007-06-21  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* cmpWrite.c (CreateInstLocList): Tcl 8.5 specific change.
	  Compensate for the INST_START_CMD the 8.5 core compiler may emit
	  before calling our LocalProcCompileProc. Not doing so leaves us
	  with an incorrect offset to the 'proc' bytecode sequence,
	  causing us to bytecompile only those procedures specified as the
	  very first command of a script, and none else.

2007-03-19  Andreas Kupries <andreask@activestate.com>

	* cmpWPkg.c: Added command 'getTclVer'. Returns the version of Tcl
	  the package was compiled against. Allows us to check this at
	  runtime against the active Tcl version.

2006-09-11  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* configure.in: Bumped version to 1.6. Regenerated configure.
	* configure:

	* cmpWrite.c: Applied patch by Uwe Traum to handle the 8.5
	  specific JumpTableInfo (compiled 'switch'). Made conditional on
	  the version of Tcl the package is compiled against.

2006-01-25  Andreas Kupries <andreask@activestate.com>

	* tclconfig/tcl.m4: Updated to TEA 3.5
	* configure.in:     Ditto.
	* configure:        Regenerated.

2005-03-22  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* Makefile.in (INCLUDES): include $includedir for cmpInt.h

2005-03-18  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* cmpWrite.c: CONST84 corrections

	* cmpWPkg.c: whitespace police

	* Makefile.in, tclconfig/tcl.m4: Updated to TEA 3.2
	* configure, configure.in:
	* mkIndex.tcl.in (removed):

2003-04-04  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* configure.in:
	* tclconfig/tcl.m4: Updated to newest tcl.m4, regenerated
	  configure's.

2002-12-02  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@pliers.activestate.com>

	* cmpWPkg.c (Tclcompiler_Init): Use 'Tcl_InitStubs' instead of
	  'Tcl_PkgRequire'. Without this change the stub-table is not
	  initialized. On windows this crashes the system when trying to
	  load tclcompiler as shared library.

	* cmpWrite.h (TCL_STORAGE_CLASS): Ensured correct storage class
	  when compiling on Windows, eliminates several warnings when
	  compiling on Windows.

	* cmpWrite.c (CompileOneProcBody): Added cast to prevent warning
	  on Windows when compiled against 8.4. Required to allow a debug
	  build.

2002-10-25  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@pliers.activestate.com>

	* cmpWrite.c (CompileOneProcBody): Removed unused variable 'nameLen'.

2002-10-15  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tclconfig/tcl.m4:
	* configure:
	* configure.in: move the CFLAGS definition into TEA_ENABLE_SHARED
	and make it pick up the env CFLAGS at configure time.

2002-10-15  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@pliers.activestate.com>

	* configure.in: Changed to propagate an initial CFLAGS value to
	  the final definition. A TEA condition (SHARED_BUILD == 1)
	  squashed it, causing it the build system to loose the
	  +DAportable we specify for the AS PA-RISC2.2 build host. This is
	  a problem for _all_ TEA and TEA 2 based configure files.

2002-10-03  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.in (INCLUDES): Added -I$(includedir) so that the
	  package is able to find the headers of tbcload (cmpInt.h,
	  proTbcLoad.h), which contain macros used by the compiler
	  too. For example CMP_VERSION.

2002-10-03  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* Makefile.in: converted build system to TEA2 spec.
	* aclocal.m4:
	* configure (new):
	* configure.in: 
	* tclconfig/README.txt (new):
	* tclconfig/install-sh (new):
	* tclconfig/tcl.m4 (new):

2002-10-01  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* cmpWPkg.c (Tclcompiler_Init): ensure version compatability with
	an exact Tcl_PkgRequire call.

2002-09-30  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* configure.in: update to v1.5.

	* cmpWrite.c (CompilerInit): adapt formatVersion to match interp.

2001-10-15  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* cmpWrite.c (LoadObjRefInfoTable): Adapted to changed signature
	  of "TclGetInstructionTable" (need an explicit cast now).

2001-10-02  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.in (install-lib-binaries): Reactivated the generation
	  of a pkgIndex.tcl file. Together with the change below the
	  compiler package is now dynamically loadable.

	* cmpWPkg.c: Changed Compiler_Init to Tclcompiler_Init to remove
	  the mismatch between function name and library name.

2001-03-14  Karl Lehenbauer <karl@procplace.com>

	* mkIndex.tcl.in: Altered Nativepath proc to work correctly with 
	  new Cygwin drive specification syntax when running on Windows.
	  (Was //d/foo -> D:/foo   Now also /cygdrive/d/foo -> D:/foo)

2000-07-24  Brent Welch <welch@ajubasolutions.com>

    * cmpWrite.c - fixed use of uninitialized variable while formatting
    error message.

2000-07-19  Brent Welch <welch@ajubasolutions.com>

    * Makefile.in - Removed use of mkIndex.tcl script,
    which is unecessary for static libraries, and broken as well.

2000-07-18  Brent Welch <welch@ajubasolutions.com>

    * Makefile.in - bug fix in install for lib_BINARIES

2000-07-18  Brent Welch <welch@ajubasolutions.com>

    * Initial working version for TclPro 1.4
